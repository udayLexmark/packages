# Resource nomenclature:
# The key appears on the left-hand side of the = and the value on the right.  The value is
# the actual string that is to be fetched.  The key should reflect or resemble the value
# reasonably, and should only contain the characters [A-Za-z0-9_].  The key should have
#  as a prefix, and this prefix should NOT be followed by an underscore.
#
# The reason for this convention is that the key will typically appear in java source code
# as a string constant.  As such, the key will be indistinguishable from any other string.
# By following this convention, it will be simple for a person or a shell script to
# distinguish a key and an ordinary string constant.
#
# We avoid separating the  prefix from the key with an underscore (or any other
# separator) because doing so would impart a word boundary on that part of the key that
# would follow the _.  This would make it hard to write scripts to operate on strings that
# are not keys.
