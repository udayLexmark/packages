<CENTER><H3>webMethods Siebel Adapter Version 6.0 SP3</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In addition to providing all available fixes for the
webMethods Siebel Adapter 6.0, Service Pack 3 provides
these new features:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Passing User Credentials at Service Run Time</B>
<P>
This new feature enables the adapter to accept
Siebel user credentials at service run time.
Previously, the adapter only allowed users to define user name
and password credentials at design time,
limiting the adapter to those credentials that
were predefined within the adapter.
This service pack provides inputs for
Siebel user names and passwords within each adapter service,
enabling users to pass those values into any
Siebel Adapter service dynamically.
This ability provides greater visibility into which
users are accessing the Siebel modules via the adapter.</P>
<LI>
<B>Case Insensitive Search in Services for Business Components</B>
<P>
Previously, the adapter provided only a case sensitive search operator
when configuring an adapter service for a selected business component.
This operator is one of the input parameters you select when
defining the search expression.
With this service pack, a case insensitive search operator
is now included.
</P>
</UL>

<P>
For detailed information about these new features,
see the
<EM>webMethods Siebel Adapter User's Guide</EM>
for SP3.
</P>

<P>
For a list of all the changes and issues
resolved since the last release,
see the readme.txt file for webMethods Siebel Adapter 6.0 SP3
on the webMethods Advantage Bookshelf
or in the directories in which you installed
webMethods Siebel Adapter 6.0 SP3.</P>

For information about previous releases of webMethods Siebel Adapter, see the release
notes for those releases, below. </P>

<CENTER>
<H3>webMethods Siebel Adapter Version 6.0</H3></CENTER>

<P>The webMethods Siebel Adapter (Siebel Adapter) is a webMethods Integration
Server adapter for integrating the webMethods Integration Platform with Siebel
applications. Using the Siebel Adapter, you can create connections to your
Siebel systems and create adapter services that perform operations on your
Siebel applications.
<P>Adapter services you create using the adapter can retrieve data from, write
data to, and invoke methods in, Siebel applications. You call adapter services
from IS flow or Java services to interact with the Siebel Server. The adapter
services perform operations by using Siebel's Business Object Interface (BOI)
API to operate on Siebel Business Components. The adapter also enables you to
invoke Siebel business services and workflows.
<P>For example, you might use the Siebel Adapter to receive new information
about a sales contact from a webMethods Integration Server client (IS client),
and then update a Contact business component record in the Siebel application.
<P>You can also interact with webMethods from a Siebel application. To do this,
you can use custom Siebel business service methods provided by webMethods, known
as EAI webMethods Transports.
<H2>Summary of Major Features</H2>
<H3>Connectivity to Siebel Applications</H3>
<P>The Siebel Adapter enables you to establish and manage connections to your
Siebel systems. Siebel connections, connections pools, and sessions are fully
managed by the adapter. Through these connections you can create and run your
Siebel integrations. </P>
<H3>Dynamically Look Up Siebel Business Components</H3>
<P>When developing your integrations, you use the adapter and its webMethods
Developer screens to view business components that reside on the Siebel Server.
From the list of business components you select the business components to
perform operations on.
<H3>Template-Based Integrations</H3>
<P>The Siebel Adapter provides service templates for interactions with the
Siebel business components. This makes it easy to develop adapter services to
interact with Siebel. </P>
<P>Service templates represent specific tasks for doing work with Siebel. For
example, a Siebel Adapter service that inserts data into Siebel is based on the
Insert service template included with the adapter. You can create specific
adapter services using the templates and invoke them from your integration
flows. </P>
<P>The Siebel Adapter provides the ability to generate adapter services that
implement the following Siebel Object Manager Interface methods:</P>
<TABLE border=1>

  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top>Query</TD>
    <TD>Executes the Siebel Query business component records</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top>Insert</TD>
    <TD>Executes the Siebel insert method to add business component
  records.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top>Update</TD>
    <TD>Executes the Siebel Get method to return the Component Interface
      matching the specified keys, or to populate the Component Interface with
      new values.</TD></TR>

    <TD vAlign=top>Delete</TD>

    records.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top>Business Service</TD>
    <TD>Invokes a Siebel business service and Siebel workflows.</TD></TR>

 </TABLE>

<H3>Siebel-to-webMethods Communications</H3>
<P>You can perform Siebel-to-webMethods operations using the EAI webMethods
Transports (Transports). The EAI webMethods Transports are custom Siebel
business service methods. While provided with the Siebel Adapter product, the
EAI webMethods Transports are independent from the Siebel Adapter itself and are
installed on the Siebel Server, rather than on the webMethods Integration Server
like the Siebel Adapter. They enable Siebel to notify Integration Server
services when a change (such as an Insert, Update, or Delete) occurs within a
particular Siebel business component. Transports are designed to provide
interactive transportation of small volumes of data between the Siebel
application and the Integration Server. Transports are built using Siebel's
eScript scripting language. </P>
<P>The transports enable you to:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Synchronously invoke a service on the Integration Server, using guaranteed
  delivery.
  <LI>Synchronously invoke a service on the Integration Server, using
  non-guaranteed delivery.
  <LI>Get a transaction's status.
  <LI>Asynchronously invoke a service on the Integration Server. </LI></UL>
<H3>Compatibility With Previous webMethods Siebel Adapters</H3>
<P>The webMethods Siebel Adapter 6.0 is a new adapter and is not compatible with
integrations built using the webMethods Siebel Adapter 3.0. That is, you cannot
use the webMethods Siebel Adapter 6.0 to run or edit services you generated
using the earlier Siebel adapters, and vice versa. </P>
<P>However, you can run the webMethods Siebel Adapter 6.0 on the same
Integration Server with earlier webMethods Siebel adapters. </P>

<H2>Platform Support</H2>
<P>For a complete listing of the versions of Siebel and of webMethods
Integration Server with which the adapter works, see the <EM>webMethods Siebel
Adapter Installation Guide 6.0</EM>.</P>
